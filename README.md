# Hey there!
## Time for a little intro 🎉

I’m a proud **dad** navigating the wild ride of sleepless nights with my little one. 👶🏼🌙

Back in school, I dabbled in IT, but now I’m part of the amazing crew at [CGDIS](https://www.cgdis.lu), serving as a **firefighter** at a cozy countryside station - the best job ever! 🚒💪

To fill my day, I dive into nerdy stuff like **software development** and work on **DIY** projects. 🛠️💻

And finally, I stand against racism and fascism. Let's be nice to each other; empathy never hurts! ✊🏽❤️
